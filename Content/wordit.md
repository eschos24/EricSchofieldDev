Wordit is based on [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle), the word puzzle game that has taken the world by storm!  Guess the word in 6 tries or less, then share your game result with friends.

## Multiple Game Modes
**Daily**:
The daily word is the same for everyone no matter where you play.

**Unlimited**:
Unlimited mode so you can hone your skills and play as long as you want.

**Word Length**:
Play Daily and Unlimited modes with 5, 6, or 7 letter words. Each word bank has thousands of words, so you'll never see the same word twice. 

## Colors
Make Wordit unique to you. Changing the colors updates the entire app as well as the results you share with friends.

## Stats
Complete stats for all modes and word lengths. Each game is scored based on the accuracy of all your guesses and you get extra points for using less guesses. 

## Coming Soon
Multiplayer and iMessage support is coming soon. [Reach out](mailto:wordit.app@ericschofield.dev) anytime with feedback and ideas for what you'd like to see in the future!

## Premium Features
The daily 5 letter word is available for free. Access the 6 and 7 letter daily words, unlimited mode, and color customization with premium access for $0.99/month or $7.99/year. Everyone gets a free 1-week trial, so try it out today! Thank you for supporting indie development.
