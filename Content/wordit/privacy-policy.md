# Wordit Privacy Policy
<hr />

## Personal Data
**Absolutely nothing.** Privacy is incredibly important to us. As such, we collect no personally identifiable information, and the information we *do* collect is the least possible to help make Wordit the best it can be. All your game information is saved on-device and in iCloud.

## Analytics and Diagnostic Data
Information such as when the event took place and device information like the model, version of iOS, and app version are collected to help with app improvements and debugging.

We use [TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com) to collect anonymous information about features used within the app. 

We use [Sentry](https://sentry.io) for crash reporting. 

We use [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com) to manage subscriptions. They create a user id and device id to manage subscriptions, but they do not have access to any personally identifiable information. 

## Questions
If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:wordit.app@ericschofield.dev).
