# Wordit Terms of Use
<hr />

## Free version
Wordit is free to download and you can play the daily 5 letter word, including hard mode.

## Premium access
Premium features, such as play daily 6 and 7 letter words, unlimited mode, and customizing the colors, are available with an auto-renewing subscription that can be purchased within the app. Premium features may be changed from time to time without prior notice. The subscription price may change without prior notice, but we will do our best to honor the original price for existing customers.

Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel at any time in your iTunes account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription. Auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. The price and duration of each subscription option is displayed on the purchase screen and updated at the time of purchase.

## Apple terms of use
Apple's ['Licensed Application End User License Agreement'](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/) is also in effect.
